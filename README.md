## Description

MorseCode_Translator_ToText is a real-time Morse code translator that can convert hand signs to text. The system utilizes computer vision techniques and deep learning algorithms to recognize and interpret hand signs captured by a camera. The application is implemented in Python, utilizing the OpenCV library and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image processing and recognition.

## Features

- Real-time translation of hand signs to text using Morse code
- Accurate recognition of hand signs with a recognition accuracy of 97%
- Supports a wide range of hand signs for comprehensive translation
- User-friendly command-line interface (CLI)
