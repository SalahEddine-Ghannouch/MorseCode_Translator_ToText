# MorseCode_Translator_ToText
<h4>
  In this Project, we present <u> a real-time Morse code translator that can convert hand signs to text.</u> The system consists of a camera that captures
  the hand signs and a software application that uses the OpenCV library and deep learning, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), 
  for image processing and recognition. The application is implemented in Python. We tested the system on a dataset of hand signs and achieved 
  a recognition accuracy of 97%.
